## 🗣️ Communication

*   Split responses if one isn't enough.
*   When providing suggestions or applying fixes, clearly indicate which you are doing (e.g., "Suggestion:", "Applying fix:").
*   Use check-ins for large tasks to confirm understanding (see `implementation-workflow.mdc` -> Interaction Guidance).
